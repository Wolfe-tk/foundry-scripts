Scripts and Macros for usage with Foundryvtt and Dnd5e

This repo will be used to maintain various scripts I use or make for foundryvtt. Some of these macros are stored for future reference and made by other authors, and some I make my own. I will try to include that information, along with any settings that need to be done at the top of each macro commented out going forward.
Common dependencies are listed below.
- Midiqol #Required
- DAE #Required
- Warpgate #Many use this
- Time's up #Required for concentration
- Active-auras #Currently working on some that utilize this
